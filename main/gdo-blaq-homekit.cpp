//
// TUNING GUIDE - how these constants relate, for future reference:
//   GDO_DOOR_STALL_CHECK_MS (8s)      - fastest possible correction; only
//                                       trusted once a real travel time is
//                                       already learned (measured_ms > 0),
//                                       and only for "motor confirmed on,
//                                       but position genuinely never moved".
//   GDO_MOTOR_ENGAGE_TIMEOUT_MS (8s)  - separate watchdog for "motor never
//                                       confirmed on at all" - a stricter,
//                                       rarer failure mode than the above.
//   measured_ms + GDO_DOOR_TRANSIT_MARGIN_MS - the normal-case ceiling once
//                                       a real travel time is known; this is
//                                       what actually governs most cycles.
//   GDO_DOOR_TRANSIT_FALLBACK_MS (35s) - used only before ANY travel time has
//                                       ever been learned this boot (first
//                                       transition in either direction) -
//                                       deliberately generous since there's
//                                       no real data yet to size it tighter.
//   GDO_OBSTRUCTION_STALE_TIMEOUT_MS (30s) - unrelated axis entirely (not a
//                                       transition timeout) - bounds how long
//                                       a confirmed Obstructed can sit with
//                                       no follow-up reading before assuming
//                                       it's stale, not gone silent.
//   GDO_LINK_STALE_TIMEOUT_MS (5min)  - the outermost safety net: catches a
//                                       fully dead UART link, independent of
//                                       whatever the door is doing.
// If you're tuning one of these because of a false-positive/negative seen in
